# 📧 Contact Form Email Options

I've set up **TWO OPTIONS** for your contact form to send emails to **nanna.abhiram25@gmail.com**

---

## ✅ OPTION 1: EmailJS (Recommended - More Professional)

**Current Setup:** The contact form is configured with EmailJS

**Status:** ⏳ Requires 5-minute setup

**Pros:**
- ✅ Emails sent directly from your website
- ✅ Professional looking
- ✅ User stays on your site
- ✅ You can track all messages
- ✅ Free for 200 emails/month

**Setup:** Follow instructions in `EMAILJS_SETUP.md`

**File:** `src/components/Contact.jsx` (currently active)

---

## ✅ OPTION 2: Mailto Link (Works Immediately)

**Status:** ✅ Ready to use - NO SETUP NEEDED

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works instantly
- ✅ No configuration required
- ✅ No external dependencies

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Opens user's email client (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- ⚠️ User might not have email client configured

**File:** `src/components/ContactSimple.jsx`

## 🔄 How to Switch Between Options

### To use SIMPLE version (mailto - works now):
